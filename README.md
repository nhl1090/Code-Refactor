# < Module Challenge 1>

## Description

The purpose of this project was to show the important of having clean, readible that is in accordance to accessibility standards. This is important because we want our deployed application optimized for any and all search engines.

Our motivation is "quality first."

We built this project to have a reference point of the standard that is required for every build. Quality must always come first.

The problem (ugly, redundant code) was resolved. Even with 20 lines of notes in the CSS file, I reduced the lines of code from 200 to 152 lines without breaking the application.

I learned that this is a good model to follow for all future projects and affirmed my belief that quality can always be improved.


## Installation

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
